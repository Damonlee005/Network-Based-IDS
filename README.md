#Network-Based-IDS

## Summary / Overview 
---
This project is an exploratory Network Based Intrusion Detection System built with Python to learn how network traffic can be analyzed for potentially harmful or malicious activity. It focuses on examining network traffic patterns, distinguishing normal baseline behavior from intrusive behavior, and testing simple detection logic using simulated traffic.

The project is designed as a learning exercise that emphasizes experimentation and understanding rather than accuracy or deployment. Network traffic data is processed offline using Python to extract basic features such as packet counts, connection patterns, and port usage. Baseline behavior is established from non intrusive traffic, and simple rule based detection logic is applied to identify deviations using simulated intrusive activity. Detection results are analyzed to observe behavior differences and understand the limitations of basic intrusion detection approaches.

## Future Work
This project is intended to grow alongside my learning in networking and cybersecurity. As I continue to develop my skills, potential future directions for this project include:

1. Learning how baseline behavior changes when using larger or more varied traffic datasets  
2. Experimenting with additional intrusion scenarios to better understand different attack patterns  
3. Exploring simple statistical or introductory machine learning techniques as learning exercises  
4. Improving feature extraction to better understand temporal and behavioral traffic characteristics  
5. Studying why false positives occur and experimenting with ways to reduce them  
6. Connecting insights from this project with concepts explored in my Network Traffic Digital Twin project  
7. Gaining exposure to performance and scalability considerations in a controlled, learning-focused environment
