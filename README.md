#Network-Based-IDS

## Summary / Overview 
---
**This project is an exploratory Network Based Intrusion Detection System built with Python to learn how network traffic can be analyzed for potentially harmful or malicious activity. It focuses on examining network traffic patterns, distinguishing normal baseline behavior from intrusive behavior, and testing simple detection logic using simulated traffic.The project is designed as a learning exercise that emphasizes experimentation and understanding rather than accuracy or deployment. Network traffic data is processed offline using Python to extract basic features such as packet counts, connection patterns, and port usage. Baseline behavior is established from non intrusive traffic, and simple rule based detection logic is applied to identify deviations using simulated intrusive activity. Detection results are analyzed to observe behavior differences and understand the limitations of basic intrusion detection approaches.
